# Energy-Hub-Optimization
Python code for optimal operation of energy hub with hydrogen energy and renewable uncertainty

## How to Run
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload MainCode.ipynb.
3. Run each cell in order.
4. The results will be shown in the output of each cell.

## Project Description
This code implements a stochastic optimization model for energy hub management, considering:
- Hydrogen energy and facilities.
- Wind/solar uncertainty.
- Demand response programs.
